				<p class="text-left text-info">Why another recipe site? Why indeed! Well. This site actually came about by my pleasant discoveries in my kitchen. When time is ripe and ingredients are right, good things come about. This is what I have discovered. Most of my recipes are totally inauthentic. They are based off and inspired by anywhere and everywhere in the world.My primary sensibilities are of course strongly rooted in my native cuisine from the state of Karnataka, south of India. And like for most people, my mother is my earliest culinary influence. Additionally, my own interests in global vegetarian cuisine, and travel influences and experiences have helped me imbibe so many new taste palettes, techniques and sensibilities. Given the time constraints of modern life, I prefer speedy, simple yet nutritious recipes. I don't much care if a recipe is a "pure-blood" or a "half-blood", as long as it meets the above requirements. This is why I lay no claim to authenticity of any dish, with regard to it's native roots. The recipes in this site are eclectic, derivative, inauthentic, but my word - so delicious if you get them right. However, the tweaking is all mine. What I make up as I go into my kitchen, though based off something I've eaten or read about, the ingredent combinations, the technique sequences - these are totally mine, unless specified otherwise. Most of the recipes here serve two healthy appetites, but I think they can work equally well for multiples (or halved). So modify sand try, if you have need a different serving size. </p>
