				<h3 class="text-left text-primary">About this site. And Me.</h3>
				<p class="text-left">Why another recipe site? Why indeed! Well. This site actually came about by my pleasant discoveries in my kitchen. When time is ripe, ingredients are right, and mood is bright, good things come about. This is what I have discovered. Most of my recipes are totally inauthentic. They are based and inspired off everywhere in the world. My Primary influence and sensibility is of course my own native cuisine from Karnataka, south of India. Like for most people, my mother is my earliest and best culinary influence, and my ultimate benchmark for taste and devotion. Additionally, my own interest and travel influences have led me to imbibe and love every kind of vegetarian cuisine from various parts of the world. That is why I lay no claim to either authenticity or perfection. But my word, they can be delicious, if you get them right. And they are usually very fast and simple to make. My recipes usually serve two, but I think they work for multiples, just as easily. So go for it, if you have a larger group to feed. </p>
				<p class="text-left">This website is a one-woman-rhodeo! I am web designer-developer, so this website is a labour of love. It has been conceived, designed and coded single-handedly by me. All the photographs are visualized and made by me in my own home, using my own dishes, props and recipes. All recipes are adapted, modified or created by me, with clear credits given to those sites/people that have inspired the same. So please, do not copy, modify or reproduce anything without credits or my express permission. You can ask me by dropping me a note at lokajaala-at-gmail.com</p>

					<h3 class="text-primary">Technical Details</h3>
					<p>This website is coded using Bootstrap as the basic framework. HTML and CSS form the basis. So the site is mobile-first and responsive in its design. It is tested for most modern browsers and should work fine for most modern devices. Let me know if you face issues that prevent you from reading any part of this website. Most icons are created using font-awesome. I have also used javascript/jQuery where necessary. All pictures are mine and copyrighted. Photographs have been created using Canon 5dMKIII camera, lightly cropped and adjusted for basic sharpness and contrast (very light! no heavy handed adding/removing/altering!!!) using Adobe photoshop. Most of the colours are left unsaturated and the dishes are very very close to how they look in reality. I shoot mostly in natural light so there is no studio setup here except a few props and DIY light modifiers and backgrounds around my home. </p>
